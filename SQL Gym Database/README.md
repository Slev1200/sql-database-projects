# 🏋️‍♂️ Gym Management Database System

**Look at the Gym_Management_Database_Document.PDF file for a full illustration of my project and how to use it.**

This repository contains a relational database project I designed and built using **SQLite** to model and manage the various operations within a gym.

| Component | Description | Key Topics |
|------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Database Design** | Created an ERD and normalized tables to handle 10 different tables, including members, staff, classes, memberships, and transactions. | relational modeling, normalization |
| **Analytical Views** | Built 4 views that included class utilization, monthly revenue, active memberships, and gym activity last 30 days. | joins, grouping, aggregation |
| **Triggers** | Implemented triggers that prevented class overbooking and auto-closed inactive memberships. | business rules, data integrity |
| **Seed Data & Queries** | Added sample data and queries for realistic analytics and reporting. | SQL scripting, testing |
